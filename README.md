# Cryptography

This repository contains the codes for several known ciphers and a few hashing algorithms. The codes for all the ciphers are in Java. Anyone with an intermediate level experience working with Java (approx. 1-2 years ) will understand the codes. Another repository of the ciphers in Python will be uploaded soon. Every code has its own documentation to explain its workings to the reader. The documentation also provides some historical context as well as the modern relevance of the cipher it describes. Some ciphers will have documentations within others. The entire list of ciphers is below:

### Simple Ciphers  
   * Caesar Cipher   
   * Beale Cipher  
   * Vignere Cipher  
   * Gronsfeld Cipher  
   * Beaufort Cipher  
   * Trithemius Cipher  
   * Checkerboard Cipher  
   * Affine Cipher  
   * ROT13  
   * Rail Fence Cipher  
   * Polybius Cipher
   * ADFGX Cipher
   * Bifid Cipher
   * Nihilist Cipher
   * Tap Code  
   * Trifid Cipher  
   * Wheatstone-Playfair cipher
   * Bacon Cipher  
   * One Time Pad

### Modern Ciphers
   * Enigma-V  
   * Lorentz SB-40
   * Feistel Network
   * Lai Maussey Network
   * RC5
   * IDEA
   * DES
   * 3DES  
   * AES - 256bit    

### Encoding
   * Base32
   * Base64
   * ASCII65
   * Baudot Code
   * URL Encoding
   * Bootstring       

### Hashing Algorithms
   * MD5
   * SHA-1
   * SHA-2

 The ciphers which do not have separate documentations are specified in others which are similar to it and have existed before. 
 Furthermore, the documentation for each cipher provides a background knowledge and mathematical
 representation of the cipher's encryption and decryption algorithms. **This documentation is simply
 to  assist the reader in understanding the working of the code.**  

The following image below shows the flowchart of documentation for all the listed ciphers.

This project has been a personal endeavor in order to provide ease of access to budding cryptography
enthusiasts out there to be able to get an understanding of the ciphers and hashing algorithms in the world of cryptography having to spend hours scouring the internet trying to make sense of the algorithms. Although this repository does not cover **everything** in cryptography, it is a good starting point from which one can learn about the rudiments of cryptography.
