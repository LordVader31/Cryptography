# Cryptography

This repository contains the codes for all known ciphers and a few hashing algorithms. This is updated every week to ensure that the codes are the most efficient and up-to-date. The entire list of ciphers is as below.  
    Simple Ciphers
        Caesar Cipher
        Beale Cipher
        Vignere Cipher
        Beaufort Cipher
        Trimesthius Cipher
        Checkerboard Cipher
